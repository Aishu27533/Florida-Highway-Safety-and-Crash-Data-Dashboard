# Florida-Highway-Safety-and-Crash-Data-Dashboard
Project Overview:
This project uses one month of crash data from the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles to create an interactive Tableau dashboard. It provides insights into the number of crashes, vehicle types involved, driver demographics, regional variations, and interesting trends in the data.

Data Source
Event Table: Details about crash incidents.
Driver Table: Driver information.
Vehicle Table: Vehicle information.
The data is structured with report_number as the key for joining the tables.
Key Features
Crash Count: Displays the total number of crashes during the one-month period.
Vehicle Type Analysis: Identifies the most frequent vehicle types involved in crashes.
Driver Demographics: Analyzes driver factors such as age and gender.
Regional Crash Variations: Highlights regions with the highest crash rates.
Exploratory Insights: Reveals trends like peak crash times and other patterns.
Tools and Technologies
Tableau for data visualization
Outer Join: Between Event, Driver, and Vehicle tables based on report_number
Data Dictionary: For translating table values.
Results and Insights
Crash Visualization: Total crashes and patterns across demographics and regions.
Vehicle Insights: Most involved vehicle types.
Driver Insights: Demographics correlated with crash occurrences.
Regional Analysis: Areas with higher crash rates highlighted.
